# Media-Server
Configuration for Media server/player built on Mini-PC

- Media Server: Jellyfin (Docker)
- Media Player: Kodi, with Jellyfin add-on.
- Firefox; for Youtube and similar sites
- wired ethernet connection with static IP address.
- Jellyfin accessible from internet

## Hardware
- Intel NUC 11ATK, N5105, 16G RAM, 512G SSD, Intel JasperLake UHD Graphics (11th Generation)
- WD Red Plus 4TB NAS HDD
- Inateck HDD enclosure https://www.amazon.com/Inateck-Aluminum-Enclosure-Support-FE3001/dp/B00UAA4J6G/
- Wireless keyboard, backlit with touchpad. (not bluetooth)
- LG 50in 4k TV, from around 2020-2021

I got the NUC on sale from Amazon. Otherwise I would have chosen a Beelink or similar
unit, 16GB RAM, with either N5105, N5095, N90, N95, N100 processor.

## Operating System
Linux Mint 21.2 "Victoria" MATE Edition. Based on Ubuntu 22.04 "Jammy Jellyfish"

- Linux Mint instead of Ubuntu because I don't want snap packages.
- MATE Desktop because I'm most familiar with it.
- XFCE is a good choice as well.
- Cinnamon is a nice Desktop, but uses more system resources than MATE or XFCE

## NOTE
- I have no 4K content. Mostly 480p. some 720p, maybe a couple 1080p
- My TV automagically "upscales", so the low-res stuff looks pretty good.
- I set all user interface settings to 1080p. If I set to 4k everything is too small.
